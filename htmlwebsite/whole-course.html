			<h2>An introduction</h2>

	<p>Laiqbun is an artistic language based in predicate logic. Despite appearances, it is not a loglang. Laiqbun&#8217;s grammar is simple, but designed in a way that gives the speaker a lot of power over the way they wish to communicate. It also has several features that are not necessary, just because they suit the ideas behind it. Laiqbun is a language that tries to separate the natural parts of a language from it, making something that is entirely humanly usable and learnable, but incredibly unnatural. At the time this course is being made, the only source of information about Laiqbun is the Official Laiqbun Documentation, which can make it a little hard to learn for people who don&#8217;t understand it&#8217;s technicalities. This course is inspired by the Toaq with Ease course, which is designed to teach Toaq (a tonal logical language which was mayor inspiration for Laiqbun in its early days) and Lojban.io.</p>

	<p>The goal of this course is, then, to teach Laiqbun in a way that is more easily understandable for someone who doesn&#8217;t understand the technical words that the documentation uses, making the language itself more accessible. The course will be divided in several lessons that will explain simple concepts, and then let you assess your understanding of its grammar.</p>

	<p>A lesson will first introduce a few words using sentences. You will first see sentences in Laiqbun, and next to then you will see their translation to English. Below these, you will see a short list of explanations of each new concept that these sentences introduce &#8211; the Laiqbun sentences will be labeled numbers that correspond to the explanation in the list.</p>

	<p>The lessons will contain exercizes that you can use to asses how much you&#8217;ve understood the concepts introduced. One form these exercizes may take is Laiqbun sentences that reuse words that have been introduced previously, using them in a new context. Next to these there will be a blurred out English translation, you can hover over it with the cursor to see it. The goal is to try and translate the Laiqbun sentence before seeing the translation. Another form these may take is by showing you Laiqbun sentences with blurred out words, and a translation of the full sentence. The goal is to try to guess what word should fill in the blank, and then check whether you used the right word.</p>

		<li><b>teuochuao</b> is a verb that means &#8220;to rain&#8221;.</li>
		<li>The word <b>dy</b> is a function word that means that the sentence is an assertion, you are saying that it is true (regardless of whether it actually is true). There are other words similar to this one for questions and imperatives, which will be explained in a future lesson.</li>
		<li>The word <b>kyo</b> is a function word that means &#8220;but&#8221;.</li>
		<li>In Laiqbun, nouns go after the verbs. The word <b>zhan</b> is a noun that means &#8220;person&#8221;, it is derived from the word <b>zhen</b>, which will be explained in a future lesson.</li>
		<li><b>hau</b> in Laiqbun is the third person singular pronoun, which can be either he, she or singular they. Singular they will be used throughout this course. <b>hau</b> can only be used to refer to living creatures or sentient entities. <b>qau</b> is used for non-living, non-sentient entities.</li>

	<ol>
		<li><b>zhen</b> is the verb that was mentioned in the previous lesson. It may seem strange to an English speaker at first: It means &#8220;to be a person&#8221;. Laiqbun lacks the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;, instead, there are verbs that replace that function. You can turn a verb into a noun by changing its first vowel to an <b>a</b>. This makes a word that means &#8220;thing that does [verb]&#8221;. <b>zhan</b> means &#8220;thing that is a person&#8221;, which is just a long way to say &#8220;person&#8221;. This can be done to every verb in Laiqbun.</li>
		<li><b>tem</b> is another example of the above, it means &#8220;to be a house&#8221;.</li>
		<li><b>len</b> is a verb that means &#8220;to be present somewhere&#8221;. It can be used as a general way to say that something is in, on or at something.</li>
		<li><b>heo</b> is a word that means &#8220;to consume&#8221;, which means it can be used both as &#8220;to drink&#8221; and &#8220;to eat&#8221;.</li>
		<li>Knowing that <b>len</b> means &#8220;to be present&#8221;, this sentence means &#8220;a cat is present in this&#8221;.</li>

		<tr>
			<td> qe kkeuacuan kaao ne dy<sup>9</sup> </td>
			<td> This bird is not blue </td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<ol>
		<li><b>by</b> is a word similar to <b>dy</b>, except that instead of asserting, it is imperative. What you say with this word in the end, is either an order or a wish.</li>
		<li><b>taru</b> is the second person plural pronoun.</li>
		<li><b>zheo</b> actually means &#8220;to exist&#8221;, but since a &#8220;thing that exists&#8221; is just a &#8220;thing&#8221;, <b>zhao</b> is usually translated that way.</li>
		<li><b>ky</b> is a similar word to <b>dy</b> and <b>by</b>, except this ones is performative. It is used to mark that something is true because you said it. <b>zeo</b> means &#8220;to greet&#8221; or &#8220;to say hi&#8221;, so, because you are saying it, it&#8217;s immediately true. &#8220;I hereby proclaim you spouses for life&#8221; is another sentence where this word would be used.</li>
		<li>When you put a word in verb form after a noun, the &#8220;verb&#8221; behaves like an adjective. You can put as many adjectives as you want.</li>
		<li>When two verbs are together in a sentence, their meanings are &#8220;stacked&#8221; into each other. <b>sheo</b> means &#8220;to want something to happen&#8221;, so <b>sheo teq</b> means &#8220;to want to say something&#8221;</li>
		<li><b>ry</b> is a function word that means &#8220;and&#8221;. It&#8217;s used to connect two nouns.</li>
		<li><b>sym</b> is a function word like <b>dy</b>, <b>by</b> and <b>ky</b>, and is used to mark interrogation.</li>
		<li><b>qe</b> means &#8220;to not be the case&#8221;</li>

	<h2>Lesson 4 &#8211; A confession</h2>

	<p>I have a confession to make. I have bamboozled you. Everything you have learnt about Laiqbun&#8217;s grammar is a lie. Well. Kinda. More or less&#8230; it&#8217;s complicated. You see, every time I&#8217;ve been showing the definition of a word, I have said it in a very Englishy manner to make it easier to understand. While this form is useful for very early learners, it doesn&#8217;t reflect the true nature of Laiqbun words. If you are inexperienced with what I am about to explain you, it might not make sense at first, but bear with me, it&#8217;ll all make sense by the time you&#8217;re done reading.</p>

	<p>Laiqbun verbs are very different from the verbs you&#8217;ll find in any natural language, and are more similar to functions in mathematics or programming, or to words in languages like Lojban or Toaq. Because of this, I will start referring to them as <b>predicates</b>. A predicate&#8217;s definition might look something like this:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>pean</b></p>

	<p style="padding-left:2em;">x1 gives/emits x2 to x3</p>

	<p>If you don&#8217;t understand what those x1, x2 and x3 mean, stay in this paragraph, if you already know, feel free to skip this and go down to &#8220;So, what was happenning with stacked verbs?&#8221;. Predicates take up to three <b>arguments</b> (a more accurate name for nouns). For example, in <b>pean sha na ta</b>, <b>sha</b> takes the place of x1, <b>na</b> takes the place of x2 and <b>ta</b> takes the place of x3. <b>x1[I] gives/emits x2[This] to x3[You]</b>. Every predicate works like this. Let&#8217;s look at another example.</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>heo</b></p>

	<p style="padding-left:2em;">x1 consumes x2</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>heo sha tauo:</b> I drink water</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;">x1[I] consumes x2[Water]</p>

	<p>So, what was going on with stacked verbs?</p>

	<p>When you put a predicate after another, you&#8217;re basically putting its definition in the x2 of the previous predicate (or in the x1, if it had only one place). Like this:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>sheo:</b> x1 wants x2 to be the case</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>heo:</b> x1 consumes x2</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>sheo heo:</b> x1 wants (x1 consumes x2) to be the case</p>

	<p>Notice that sheo heo has two x1. This is normal. It means that they are filled as the same thing. Look:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>sheo heo sha tauo:</b> I want to drink water</p>

	<p style="padding-left:2em;">x1[I] wants (x1[I] consumes x2[Water])</p>

	<p>Predicates that are stacked like this are called <b>serial predicates</b>. &#8220;Function words&#8221; (words that have <b>y</b> as their first vowel and only exist for grammatical reasons) are called &#8220;particles&#8221;.</p>


	<p>And that&#8217;s it, really! You now understand Laiqbun&#8217;s words more accurately. From now on, all the verb definitions will use the form you just learnt, and you will be able to use the <a href="https://ampersandia.neocities.org/roxy/laiqbun/laiqbun-dictionary.html">dictionary</a> to learn words.

	<ol>
		<li><b>peushu</b> is a verb that means &#8220;x1 is mine/of the speaker&#8221;. Similar verbs exist for all pronouns, such as <b>peushuru</b> for &#8220;x1 is ours&#8221;, <b>peutu</b> for &#8220;x1 is yours&#8221; or <b>peuhu</b> for &#8220;x1 is hers/his/theirs&#8221;.</li>
		<li><b>hy</b> turns the verb that goes after it into a preposition. Prepositions describe the entire sentence. This sentence says &#8220;I am eating&#8221;, and then says that the action &#8220;is present in my house&#8221;.</li>
		<li>The predicate <b>se</b> marks the beginning of a proper name. Using <b>shy</b> ends the name. <b>se Keiti shy</b> means &#8220;x1 is Katie&#8221;.</li>
		<li>Knowing that <b>se Katie shy</b> means &#8220;x1 is Katie&#8221;, <b>sa Katie shy</b> means &#8220;Katie&#8221;.</li>
		<li><b>pe</b> is a verb that means &#8220;x1 was the case in the past&#8221;. Similar verbs for future and present exist, these are, respectively, ceum and teoq.</li>
		<li><b>veo</b> is a word that means &#8220;x1 is the case&#8221;. It can be used as &#8220;yes&#8221;. Similarly, <b>qe</b> can be used as &#8220;no&#8221;.</li>

		<li>When the first vowel of a word is <b>o</b>, it is a sentence that is describing a noun. For example, the phrase &#8220;the person who drinks water&#8221;. &#8220;Drink water&#8221; is what the person does.</li>
		<li>When a sentence is describing a noun, the word <b>kka</b> refers to the noun that is being described. In &#8220;the person who drinks water&#8221;, &#8220;who&#8221; is <b>kka</b> in Laiqbun, but as you learnt in the first lesson, verbs always go first in Laiqbun. For now, lets pretend <b>kka</b> has no form other than its noun form.</li>
		<li>When a sentence is describing a noun, and you wish to go back to the main part of the sentence, you use <b>gy</b>.</li>
		<li>The verb <b>zeai</b> means &#8220;x1 is what?&#8221; and is used for questions that are not yes/no.</li>
		<li>When the first vowel of a word is <b>i</b>, it is a sentence that behaves as a noun. For example, in the sentence &#8220;I know <b>things</b>&#8221;, &#8220;things&#8221; is a noun. Now, in a sentence like &#8220;I know <b>that you did this</b>&#8221;, &#8220;you did this&#8221; takes the same place as &#8220;things&#8221;, even though it has a verb. Similar to how it is with <b>o</b> words, if you wish to end an <b>i</b> word and return to the main sentence, you use <b>gy</b>.</li>

		<li>An &#8220;if&#8221; has two parts, what comes before (called the antecedent), and its consequences (called the consequent). In a phrase like &#8220;if you eat too much, you&#8217;ll get sick&#8221;, &#8220;you eat too much&#8221; is the antecedent and &#8220;you&#8217;ll get sick&#8221; is the consequent. <b>tteun</b> is used when we already know that the antecedent is true, and there is no way that the consequent is not true. If you are in Paris, then there&#8217;s no way you are not in France. (This sentence assumes that the listener is currently in France)</li>
		<li><b>ppeaq</b> is used when we already know that the antecedent is true, but the consequent is not necessarily the case. But if the antecedent was false, then tere is no way that the consequent is true. The sentence assumes that the listener is in France, and because of this, there&#8217;s a chance that they are in Paris. However, if they were not in France, there is no way that they could be in Paris.</li>
		<li><b>leuan</b> is used when we don&#8217;t know if the antecent is true, or when we know that it&#8217;s false, but if it were true, then there would be no way that the consequent is false.</li>
		<li><b>geui</b> is used when we don&#8217;t know if the antecent is true, or when we know that it&#8217;s false, but if it were true, then the consequent is possible (even if it&#8217;s not necessarily true). But, if the antecedent is false, then there is no way that the consequent is true.</li>
		<li>If the first vowel of a word is <b>o</b>, and it&#8217;s right after the verbs of a sentence, it&#8217;s an adverb.</li>
		<li>A preposition without a noun after it is another way to do adverbs.</li>
		<li><b>ppeai</b> means &#8220;x1 is most of x2&#8221;. Using <b>o</b> adverbs on &#8220;if&#8221; words sets a &#8220;restriction&#8221; to the antecedent. &#8220;If it&#8217;s raining, with the restriction that it&#8217;s most of those moments, I don&#8217;t go outside&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;If it rains most of the time, I go outside&#8221;</li>
		<li><b>geau</b> means &#8220;x1 is big&#8221;, but as an adverb it can mean &#8220;a lot&#8221;.</li>
