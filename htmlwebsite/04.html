			<h2>Lesson 4 &#8211; A confession</h2>

	<p>I have a confession to make. I have bamboozled you. Everything you have learnt about Laiqbun&#8217;s grammar is a lie. Well. Kinda. More or less&#8230; it&#8217;s complicated. You see, every time I&#8217;ve been showing the definition of a word, I have said it in a very Englishy manner to make it easier to understand. While this form is useful for very early learners, it doesn&#8217;t reflect the true nature of Laiqbun words. If you are inexperienced with what I am about to explain you, it might not make sense at first, but bear with me, it&#8217;ll all make sense by the time you&#8217;re done reading.</p>

	<p>Laiqbun verbs are very different from the verbs you&#8217;ll find in any natural language, and are more similar to functions in mathematics or programming, or to words in languages like Lojban or Toaq. Because of this, I will start referring to them as <b>predicates</b>. A predicate&#8217;s definition might look something like this:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>pean</b></p>

	<p style="padding-left:2em;">x1 gives/emits x2 to x3</p>

	<p>If you don&#8217;t understand what those x1, x2 and x3 mean, stay in this paragraph, if you already know, feel free to skip this and go down to &#8220;So, what was happenning with stacked verbs?&#8221;. Predicates take up to three <b>arguments</b> (a more accurate name for nouns). For example, in <b>pean sha na ta</b>, <b>sha</b> takes the place of x1, <b>na</b> takes the place of x2 and <b>ta</b> takes the place of x3. <b>x1[I] gives/emits x2[This] to x3[You]</b>. Every predicate works like this. Let&#8217;s look at another example.</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>heo</b></p>

	<p style="padding-left:2em;">x1 consumes x2</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>heo sha tauo:</b> I drink water</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;">x1[I] consumes x2[Water]</p>

	<p>So, what was going on with stacked verbs?</p>

	<p>When you put a predicate after another, you&#8217;re basically putting its definition in the x2 of the previous predicate (or in the x1, if it had only one place). Like this:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>sheo:</b> x1 wants x2 to be the case</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>heo:</b> x1 consumes x2</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>sheo heo:</b> x1 wants (x1 consumes x2) to be the case</p>

	<p>Notice that sheo heo has two x1. This is normal. It means that they are filled as the same thing. Look:</p>

	<p style="padding-left:1em;"><b>sheo heo sha tauo:</b> I want to drink water</p>

	<p style="padding-left:2em;">x1[I] wants (x1[I] consumes x2[Water])</p>

	<p>Predicates that are stacked like this are called <b>serial predicates</b>. &#8220;Function words&#8221; (words that have <b>y</b> as their first vowel and only exist for grammatical reasons) are called &#8220;particles&#8221;.</p>


	<p>And that&#8217;s it, really! You now understand Laiqbun&#8217;s words more accurately. From now on, all the verb definitions will use the form you just learnt, and you will be able to use the <a href="https://ampersandia.neocities.org/roxy/laiqbun/laiqbun-dictionary.html">dictionary</a> to learn words.
