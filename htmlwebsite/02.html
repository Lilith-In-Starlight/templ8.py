		<li><b>zhen</b> is the verb that was mentioned in the previous lesson. It may seem strange to an English speaker at first: It means &#8220;to be a person&#8221;. Laiqbun lacks the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;, instead, there are verbs that replace that function. You can turn a verb into a noun by changing its first vowel to an <b>a</b>. This makes a word that means &#8220;thing that does [verb]&#8221;. <b>zhan</b> means &#8220;thing that is a person&#8221;, which is just a long way to say &#8220;person&#8221;. This can be done to every verb in Laiqbun.</li>
		<li><b>tem</b> is another example of the above, it means &#8220;to be a house&#8221;.</li>
		<li><b>len</b> is a verb that means &#8220;to be present somewhere&#8221;. It can be used as a general way to say that something is in, on or at something.</li>
		<li><b>heo</b> is a word that means &#8220;to consume&#8221;, which means it can be used both as &#8220;to drink&#8221; and &#8220;to eat&#8221;.</li>
		<li>Knowing that <b>len</b> means &#8220;to be present&#8221;, this sentence means &#8220;a cat is present in this&#8221;.</li>
