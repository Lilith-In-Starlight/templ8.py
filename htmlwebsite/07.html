		<li>When the first vowel of a word is <b>o</b>, it is a sentence that is describing a noun. For example, the phrase &#8220;the person who drinks water&#8221;. &#8220;Drink water&#8221; is what the person does.</li>
		<li>When a sentence is describing a noun, the word <b>kka</b> refers to the noun that is being described. In &#8220;the person who drinks water&#8221;, &#8220;who&#8221; is <b>kka</b> in Laiqbun, but as you learnt in the first lesson, verbs always go first in Laiqbun. For now, lets pretend <b>kka</b> has no form other than its noun form.</li>
		<li>When a sentence is describing a noun, and you wish to go back to the main part of the sentence, you use <b>gy</b>.</li>
		<li>The verb <b>zeai</b> means &#8220;x1 is what?&#8221; and is used for questions that are not yes/no.</li>
		<li>When the first vowel of a word is <b>i</b>, it is a sentence that behaves as a noun. For example, in the sentence &#8220;I know <b>things</b>&#8221;, &#8220;things&#8221; is a noun. Now, in a sentence like &#8220;I know <b>that you did this</b>&#8221;, &#8220;you did this&#8221; takes the same place as &#8220;things&#8221;, even though it has a verb. Similar to how it is with <b>o</b> words, if you wish to end an <b>i</b> word and return to the main sentence, you use <b>gy</b>.</li>
