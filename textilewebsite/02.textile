h3. Sentences

| zhen sharu dy[^1^] | We are people |
| tem na dy[^2^] | This is a house |
| len sharu tam dy[^3^] | We are in the house |

# **zhen** is the verb that was mentioned in the previous lesson. It may seem strange to an English speaker at first: It means "to be a person". Laiqbun lacks the verb "to be", instead, there are verbs that replace that function. You can turn a verb into a noun by changing its first vowel to an **a**. This makes a word that means "thing that does [verb]". **zhan** means "thing that is a person", which is just a long way to say "person". This can be done to every verb in Laiqbun.
# **tem** is another example of the above, it means "to be a house".
# **len** is a verb that means "to be present somewhere". It can be used as a general way to say that something is in, on or at something.
# **heo** is a word that means "to consume", which means it can be used both as "to drink" and "to eat".
# Knowing that **len** means "to be present", this sentence means "a cat is present in this".
