| my pei laiq ne sa Keiti shy dy[^1^] | This language was made by Katie |
| ty peaa vauin dy[^2^] | The window breaks |
| ty keoiq ta by | Love yourself |

# **my** marks passive voice. It inverts what x1 and x2 do, **pei** means "x1 creates x2", so **my pei** means "x1 is created by x2"
# **ty** marks middle voice. This is a concept that English barely has. It merges x1 and x2. **peaa** means "x1 breaks x2", so **ty peaa** means "x1 breaks x1". In this example, the window isn't broken by anybody, but it is broken. It just, by itself, is in the state of being broken.
# **cy** marks ultrapassive voice - this concept is unique to Laiqbun. Inverts what every argument does. **pean** means "x1 gives/emits x2 to x3", so **cy pean** means "to x1, x2 is given/emitted by x3"
# Voice markers can be applied to arguments too. **hao** means "one that eats", so **my hao** means "one that is eaten".
