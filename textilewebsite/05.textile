# **peushu** is a verb that means "x1 is mine/of the speaker". Similar verbs exist for all pronouns, such as **peushuru** for "x1 is ours", **peutu** for "x1 is yours" or **peuhu** for "x1 is hers/his/theirs".
# **hy** turns the verb that goes after it into a preposition. Prepositions describe the entire sentence. This sentence says "I am eating", and then says that the action "is present in my house".
# The predicate **se** marks the beginning of a proper name. Using **shy** ends the name. **se Keiti shy** means "x1 is Katie".
# Knowing that **se Katie shy** means "x1 is Katie", **sa Katie shy** means "Katie".
# **pe** is a verb that means "x1 was the case in the past". Similar verbs for future and present exist, these are, respectively, ceum and teoq.
# **veo** is a word that means "x1 is the case". It can be used as "yes". Similarly, **qe** can be used as "no".
